Reflections is a python script made for the purpose of seeing if there are any reflected parameters in a given URL

This tool can be used in conjunction with a tool like Arjun to find parameters to test for Reflected XSS vulnerabilities

`-i`: use single url as input

`-f`: use a file of urls as input
